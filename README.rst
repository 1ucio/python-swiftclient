Python bindings to the OpenStack Object Storage API
===================================================

This is a python client for the Swift API. There's a Python API (the
``swiftclient`` module), and a command-line script (``swift``).

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined
in the `OpenStack wiki`__.

This code is based on original the client previously included with
`OpenStack's Swift`__ The python-swiftclient is licensed under the
